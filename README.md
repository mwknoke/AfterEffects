# AfterEffects
General collection of what I have been learning on After Effects, including guides and project ideas! 

My name is Marcus, and this is my repository for my journey through AfterEffects! It has definitely been an interesting one, and I am excited to begin gathering my experiences and writing tutorials alongside my projects. 

I am currently working on an Electoral College video project, which can be accessed through the MD file "ElectoralCollege"
